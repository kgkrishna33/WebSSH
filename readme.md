This is a forked repo.

The WebSSH project as its name suggest, is a SSH over the WEB. Generally we install SSH clients like Putty, Mputty etc. to connect to a SSH server. However, sometimes it is not permissible to install third party apps on the machine due to some restrictions. The WebSSH is created to solve this problem.

You can host WebSSH within your organization to connect to SSH servers within organization boundaries or beyond.

<strong>Why this project?</strong><br>
There are many WebSSH projects are already exist which can address this problem. But, most of them are using node js, python etc. in the backend. This project will be helpful for someone who wants to use Java at the backend. This will help java developers to integrate the WebSSH funtionality into their existing java development environment. specially those who are working with Spring MVC, Spring boot etc.
